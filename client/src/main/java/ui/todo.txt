Questions:
1. Does the command have to be redraw chess board or can it be shortened to redraw?
2. Same as question 1 for highlight legal moves.
3. Do I need to make unit tests for this phase?
9. Check should notify all players? Yes
10. CheckMate should notify all players? Yes

Notifications:
1. join notification should say the players color and name (done)
2. observe notification should include observer name (done)
   - Something is wrong with my observe where it won't print the game (done)
   - it also notifies other players as join instead of observed
3. check notification (player's name)
4. checkmate notification (player's name)

5. do server tests again to see if they work
